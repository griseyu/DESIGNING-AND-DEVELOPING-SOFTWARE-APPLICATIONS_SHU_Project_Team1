## Main functions of the application:
The purpose of this application is to provide users with personalised recommendations for skin care, hair care and make up products based on a number of ingredient criteria selected by them; this is referred to as to as a prescription.
On visiting the site, the user is presented with a home page containing featured products and video recommendations. From here the user can navigate between individual pages where their preferences can be selected in checkboxes.
On submitting the selections, the user is directed to a new page containing a table of results displaying the suggested product name, a link to purchase the product from and a photograph of the product. On this page, the results can be saved to their account for future reference, or the selections can be made again by clicking a ‘back’ button to return the user to the selection page.
The user must first register to use these features but can access the home page without logging in. After the user is logged in, they will be directed to their profile page where they will be presented with the option to view their previous prescriptions or create a new submission. The user can then choose to log out and be redirected to the home screen.
The application is designed with a client side and server side. The server side handles interactions with the database including customer registration, login and product recommendation queries. The client side is used only to display this information to the customers ensuring a higher degree of security.
The application has been developed with mobile first usability ensuring the pages are responsive to the size of screen the user is viewing it from. To achieve this, the menu bar is designed to collapse into a burger menu under a set screen size threshold as well as designing the on-screen containers to wrap around and stack vertically rather than horizontally when being viewed on smaller screens.

## Work approach:
